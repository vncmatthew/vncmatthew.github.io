      <p>Wizy.io has provided me with an amazing experience wherein I got to learn
        about the IT industry as well as being a Quality Assurance analyst.</p>

      <p>In Wizy.io, the company had three main products, them being WizyVision, 
        WizyEMM, and GoWizApp. I was assigned to the team of WizyEMM. Our team consisted 
        of two frontend developers, two backend developers, and two QA’s. The frontend devs and QA were 
        based in Manila while the two backend developers were based in France. </p>

      <p>I joined Wizy on September 5, 2023, during my first few weeks, I was oriented about the company’s 
        mission and vision, the rules, what type of company Wizy was, as well as about the team that I was going to 
        be joining. During all of that, I was also getting oriented about the fundamentals of quality assurance, I was 
        asked to make a report about them and present them afterwards. This ensured that what I was reporting on was understood 
        completely. If ever I had any questions, I could ask my supervisor and it would be cleared.</p>

      <p>Throughout the internship, I was able to experience exploratory testing, creation of test plans and test cases, smoke testing, 
        API testing, and daily test activities. I was mainly responsible for checking the fixes for the bugs previously reported on the 
        past versions. I would make test plans for them, test them, and create test evidence to ensure that the feature or bug is fixed.</p>

      <p>Meetings were conducted weekly with the whole Manila office as a way of checking up and reporting on company activities such as 
        “Fun Fridays” which are engagement activities done every Friday to boost company morale, Sports fest, which was an ongoing fest filled 
        with both physical games, board games, and online games, and other announcement for the company. Daily SCRUM meetings were also done by 
        each product team to discuss what was done, what will be done, and if there are any problems, this was conducted because Wizy utilized the AGILE 
        methodology to ensure fast paced production while ensuring quality. Bi-weekly meetings were also conducted within our team that included the backend 
        devs from France to plan for the next sprints.</p>

      <p>There were also other activities that I experienced in Wizy including Kris Kringle and the Year End Party that included the company’s CEO that came 
        all the way from France. It was a fun experience and relaxing as well as we were not always doing work.</p>

      <p>Overall, my internship experience in Wizy.io was great. I got to learn a lot of new knowledge, skills, and information, I also got to meet a lot of 
        new people that I connected with on LinkedIn. I would like to thank my supervisor, the WizyEMM team, other people from the other teams that I got to spend 
        time with, my fellow interns, and Wizy. It was an experience that I will treasure as it was my first experience in the professional IT industry and it was an 
        overwhelmingly positive experience.</p>

        <p>Below are some softwares and applications we use to do testing and communicate within the company.</p>

      <p>Above is the software we used to keep track of test cases, test plans, and is used when performing smoke and regression testing. It is called Testiny.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Above is an example of a Google Sheets file for test plans that we create. We create test plans so that we can test new features and bug fixes. Bug reports are also done in Google Sheets as it makes it easier to share and see for everyone. Creating bug reports and test plans must be straighforward, detailed, and simple so that it can be understood by everyone in the team and to avoid 
        too many questions that could slow down productivity. By making it straightforward, detailed, and coherent, time is saved, and productivity is improved.
