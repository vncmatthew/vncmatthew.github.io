      <p>I have started my org life journey since Frosh. I joined AIM or Association of Information Management as a Documentation Committee Member and was able to become an officer within the organization as the head for the Documentation Committee by my second year. AIM is the home org of my course which is BS-IS.</p>

      <p>Throughout my stay in AIM, I was able to experience what itâ€™s like to handle events and to communicate effectively with my peers to achieve a desired output. I was able to meet a lot of people and some even became my friends.</p>

      <p>In my third year, I joined GDSC or Google Developer Students Club as the Internet of Things Lead under the Technology Department. As the IoT Lead, I helped our CTO handle and organize events within the department. We were also able to host a workshop for Jetpack Compose as well as help with organizing events for the whole organization.</p>
