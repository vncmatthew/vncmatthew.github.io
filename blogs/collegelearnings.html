      <p>I would describe my college life as cut short. With my first two years of college being online, it did not really feel like I was experiencing the most out of it. However, I was still able to learn a lot of things and meet new people. For that, I am thankful.</p>

      <p>I am Matthew, currently a 4th Year BS - Information System student in De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde. I am currently taking on my last few terms as a student and will be graduating soon. My collective experience and learnings during college will be what will keep me equipped for the professional world.</p>

      <p>Throughout my stay in DLS-CSB, I was able to learn and develop my skills and knowledge. From the basics and fundamentals of programming to the advanced intricacies and deployment of websites, it really has been a long way from where I began. I was able to learn how to develop interactive websites that people 
        could use as well as develop mobile applications that people can install on their phones. I was able to learn programming languages such as Java, C#, and Kotlin.</p>

      <p>For my OJT or internship, I was able to get an internship at a startup company named Wizy as a Quality Assurance Associate intern. I was able to apply my learnings from a subject in our curriculum named SOFTEST wherein we got to learn the fundamentals of software testing and different methods to test software or websites.</p>
    
      <p>Overall, college was an experience. The face-to-face experience may have been short, but I was able to make the most of it. Thank you DLS-CSB, thank you to my peers, thank you to my professors, and thank you to myself for surviving college.</p>
